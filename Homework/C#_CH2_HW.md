1. NO they're two different things. Value types directly contain data while primitive types are first and the main type.

1. Arithmetic operators need variable types to be able to do anything, what the operator does depends on what the type is.

1. You can use a command such as .ToString() or string count = "" + intCount;

1. You can use a .parse method to change a int to a string.

1. Precedence is priority in vertical, associativity is priority in horizontal. Makes a difference in expressions. 

1. When you must assign a value to a variable before you can use it; otherwise, your program will not compile.

1. Prefix is in the front and postfix follows it up.

1. Renders many uses of the + operator obsolete for concatenating strings.

1. It causes the compiler to deduce the type of the variables from the types of the expressions used to initialize them.
