1. What are all possible values of a Boolean expression?	

   - True or False

2. List eight Boolean operators.

   - ==, != , < , <= , > , >= , true , false

3. What is the general concept of short circuiting? This question has a short and simple answer and you do not need to have a detailed response.

   - It allows you to tell if all your outputs are uniform. I.E. if everything is true it'll be true but if one expression is false then all are false. Saving computing time.

4. What are the difference in how short circuiting works for && and ||?

   - && is if one expression is false they are all false. || is if one expression is true they are all true.

5. Look at the list of operators. What operator has the highest precedence? Which has the lowest?

   - () has the highest precedence, = has the lowest precedence.

6.  In an if or else construction using multiple lines of code, what effect does the use of curly braces have?

   - lets you "block" certain information into those specific categories if or else.

7. In a switch statement, what happens if you omit break?

   - The switch will continue to run and not know when to stop

8. What is a recursive method? Using a language you know (such as English), write a recursive method that adds up the integers in a list of integers. The input to the method is a list of integers and the output is a scalar value representing a sum.

   - Something that happens again and again and is easily simplified. So if I wanted to add all the integers I would do if there is no integer left stop adding, if there is a integer left add one and start again and check if there is a integer left.

9. (Not in book) Read a short summary of De Morgan’s laws. (a) Explain how this statement, ”It’s not snowing or raining,” is the same as this statement, ”It’s not snowing and it’s not raining.” (b) Explain how this statement, ”I’m not running and walking,” is the same as this statement, ”I’m not running or I’m not walking.”

   -a "It’s not snowing or raining,” gives you a true outcome and ”It’s not snowing and it’s not raining.” gives you a false outcome. Therefore it's not a true statement. 

   -b. "I'm not running and walking" gives you a false outcome and "I"m not running or I'm not walking" gives you a false put come so they're both the same.
