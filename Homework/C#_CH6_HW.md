1. What is an exception?

   - A problem that arises during the execution of a program.

2. What happens in a try block if the program executes without errors?

   - It runs the try and does the finally.

3.  How does the catch mechanism work for unhandled exceptions?

   - If there is an incorrect input or error it redirects the code to do something else other then shutting down.

4. What happens in a program if an exception block fails to handle an particular error?

   - the program will fail unless there's a catch of sorts.

5. . What is the parent class for all exceptions? How does this work?

   - The object class.

6. How do you determine the type of an error?

   - The exception gives a message and source of the error.

7. What is the purpose of integer checking?

   - So you know that your *int* values wonâ€™t reach their limits.

8. What is the range of values than a signed Int32 type can contain? State the lowest value and the highest value.

   - -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

9. What is the range of values than an unsigned Int32 type can contain? State the lowest value and the highest value. What is the difference between a signed integer and an unsigned integer? Can signed integers and unsigned integers represent the same amount of numbers?

   - 0 to 4,294,967,295 , they can represent the same amount of int but in a different value.

10. What does the finally block do?

    - Writes a finally block of code that runs no matter what.

11. When would you not use a finally block in a try/catch construction?

    - when the try or the catch already gave you the desired outcome.
